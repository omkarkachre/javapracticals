Types of containers:

There are four types of containers in Java AWT:

Window
Panel
Frame
Dialog
Window
The window is the container that have no borders and menu bars. You must use frame, dialog or another window for creating a window. We need to create an instance of Window class to create this container.

Panel
The Panel is the container that doesn't contain title bar, border or menu bar. It is generic container for holding the components. It can have other components like button, text field etc. An instance of Panel class creates a container, in which we can add components.

Frame
The Frame is the container that contain title bar and border and can have menu bars. It can have other components like button, text field, scrollbar etc. Frame is most widely used container while developing an AWT application.
